# CSCI_400
# Welcome to my school PHP repository! #
This repository contains all of my PHP assignments for my school course. Each assignment is contained within its own folder, with the name of the assignment and the date it was completed.

The assignments in this repository demonstrate my understanding of various PHP concepts such as:

* variables and data types
* control structures (if/else, switch, etc.)
* functions and arrays
* working with forms and GET/POST requests
* connecting to a MySQL database
# Examples #
Here are some basic examples of the PHP concepts covered in this repository:

# Variables and Data Types #
```php
<?php
    $name = "John Doe";
    $age = 25;
    $isStudent = true;

    echo "My name is " . $name . " and I am " . $age . " years old.";
?>
```
# Control Structures #
```php
<?php
    $age = 18;
    if ($age >= 18) {
        echo "You are old enough to vote.";
    } else {
        echo "You are not old enough to vote.";
    }
?>
```
# Functions #
```php
<?php
    function greet($name) {
        echo "Hello, " . $name . "!";
    }

    greet("John"); // Outputs: "Hello, John!"
?>
```php
# Arrays #
```php
<?php
    $fruits = array("apple", "banana", "orange");
    echo "I like " . $fruits[0] . ", " . $fruits[1] . " and " . $fruits[2] . ".";
?>
```

To run the code in these assignments, you will need a web server with PHP installed. You can use a local development environment such as XAMPP or MAMP, or you can use a hosting service that supports PHP.

Thank you for visiting my repository. I hope you find my assignments informative and well-written.
