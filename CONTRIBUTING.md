1.	Communication: Before starting any work, it is recommended to communicate with the team to avoid duplicated efforts. Use the repository's issue tracker, pull requests or any other communication channel to discuss the changes you are proposing.
2.	Fork the repository: To make changes, you will need to create your own fork of the repository. This will allow you to make changes in your own copy of the code and submit a pull request to merge your changes back into the original repository.
3.	Create a branch: It is a good practice to create a new branch for each change you are making. This will make it easier to track and manage your changes, and to keep your fork organized.
4.	Write clean, readable and well-documented code: Follow the coding standards and naming conventions used in the repository. Make sure your code is well-documented and easy to understand.
5.	Test your changes: Before submitting a pull request, make sure to test your changes thoroughly. Check for any bugs or issues, and ensure that your changes do not cause any unintended consequences.
6.	Submit a pull request: Once you have made your changes and tested them, you can submit a pull request to merge your changes back into the original repository. Make sure to provide a clear and concise description of your changes, and any relevant information.
7.	Review and feedback: The repository maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. They may request additional changes or clarification before accepting the pull request.
8.	Keep your fork up-to-date: As the original repository changes, you will need to keep your fork up-to-date. This can be done by regularly pulling the changes from the original repository into your fork.
